    <img src="../Assets/DaveandTheresa.jpg" id= "daveAndTheresaPic">
    <p class="textParagraph">Meet Dave and Theresa Baker, the skilled hands and creative minds behind Fellowcraft Leather, a husband-and-wife team bringing stunning, high-quality leather goods to life right here in Story City, Iowa. Longtime local residents,  Dave and Theresa's love for their community runs deep—and so does their passion for their craft.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph">Dave, an Iowa native and Navy veteran, first picked up leatherwork as a creative outlet during his work travels. What began as a hobby has evolved into a small business grounded in patience, precision, and pride. A self-taught craftsman, Dave honed his skills through years of trial and error, learning from how-to videos and real hands-on experience. Theresa joined the leatherworking journey a little over a year ago, helping add beautiful laser-engraved details to their pieces, which quickly became one of their signature touches.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph">The craftsmanship behind their work is a true labor of love. From designing the piece to selecting the perfect leather—soft and supple for tote bags, or thick and sturdy for journal covers and holsters—every step is intentional. Their process includes cutting, punching, dyeing, molding, beveling, stitching (often by hand), and finishing each item with care. Whether it's an insulated coozie, a stylish bottle bag, or a custom piece, the Bakers ensure every item is both functional and beautiful.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph">
    One meaningful hallmark of their work is the small but powerful imprint of “988”, the number for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, subtly placed on many of their pieces as a reminder of hope and the importance of mental health awareness. 
    </p>
    <p class="textParagraph">
    Outside of the workshop, Dave and Theresa enjoy cheering on the Iowa Wild, exploring breweries, catching concerts, traveling, and attending NASCAR races—but they always find time to create.
    Looking for a one-of-a-kind leather piece or a personalized gift? Fellowcraft Leather is ready to help you bring your vision to life.
